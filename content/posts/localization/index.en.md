I'm thrilled to share that the blog posts are now available in both Portuguese and English! I recently updated Hugo to incorporate a localization system into my blog. While I'm still working on resolving a few remaining issues (such as limited functionality of files and search, currently only working in the English version of the blog), I'm committed to fixing them as soon as possible.

The addition of the localization system is a significant milestone in making my blog content more accessible and comprehensive for both national and international audiences.

I apologize for the current technical issues. I'm dedicating time and resources to address these concerns and ensure that every visitor to the blog has an exceptional experience. Thank you for your patience as I work on resolving these problems, and I hope you'll continue to follow my blog for the latest updates.

If you have any suggestions or encounter any issues while navigating the blog, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you so much for your ongoing support and for being part of this journey. Together, we will make my blog an increasingly enriching and inclusive space for everyone.
