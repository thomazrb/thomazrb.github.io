Wondering about how to generate favicons for various formats for my website, I noticed on the FAQs of the theme I'm using ([Hugo PaperMod FAQs](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/FAQs#adding-custom-favicons)) that they recommended an online service to automatically generate the necessary favicons: [favicon.io](https://favicon.io).

It's a free service that generates favicons based on an image, text, or emoji. Very interesting and saves a bit of work.
